# Project 3 - Exploratory Data Anlysis

### Introduction and Question Identification

This dataset includes recipes and ratings from the website [food.com](https://www.food.com). The question that the analysis will be centered around is: **What recipes tend to be lower in calories?**This question is important because understanding what types of recipes tend to be lower in calories can help individuals identify healthier food choices.

The original raw datasets include one for recipes, `RAW_interactions.csv`, and one for ratings, `RAW_ratings.csv`. `RAW_interactions.csv` has 83782 rows of data, and `RAW_interactions.csv` has 731927 rows of data. The relevant columns for this analysis are: `nutrition`, `n_steps`, `n_ingredients`, `rating`, and `review`. `nutrition` is the nutrition information in the form [calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), carbohydrates (PDV)]; PDV stands for “percentage of daily value”. `n_steps` is the number of steps in the recipe. `n_ingredients` is the number of ingredients in the recipe. `rating` is the rating given. `review` is the review text.
